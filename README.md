# Advent-of-code-2023
<h4>Finally after many years of starting advent of code (proud procrastinator since 2018) I will finallyâ€¦ maybe do all of them?</h4>


# ðŸ“˜ Rules 
<ul>
<li>New programming language every day??? (I will do this until I have to start reusing them because I don't know even close to 25, but I will attempt to get creative with it)</li>
<li>I guess I will consider it a new languge if it has a diffrent file extension, or uses some mainstream large library or tool (unity, Node.js, etc) </li>
<li>End of rules</li>
</ul>

# ðŸ“œ Devlog
