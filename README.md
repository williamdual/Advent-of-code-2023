<h4>Finally after many years of starting advent of code (proud procrastinator since 2018) I will finallyâ€¦ maybe do all of them?</h4>


# ðŸ“˜ Rules 
<ul>
<li>New programming language every day??? (I will do this until I have to start reusing them because I don't know even close to 25, but I will attempt to get creative with it)</li>
<li>End of rules</li>
</ul?>
